## Name

`tcp-logger` is a plugin which push Log data requests to TCP servers.

This will provide the ability to send Log data requests as JSON objects to Monitoring tools and other TCP servers.

This plugin provides the ability to push Log data as a batch to your external TCP servers. In case if you did not receive the log data don't worry give it some time it will automatically send the logs after the timer function expires in our Batch Processor.

For more info on Batch-Processor in Apache APISIX please refer.

The plugin supports the use of batch processors to aggregate and process entries(logs/data) in a batch. This avoids frequent data submissions by the plugin, which by default the batch processor submits data every `5` seconds or when the data in the queue reaches `1000`. For information or custom batch processor parameter settings, see [Batch-Processor](../batch-processor.md#configuration) configuration section.

## How To Enable

The following is an example on how to enable the tcp-logger for a specific route.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/5 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
      "plugins": {
            "tcp-logger": {
                 "host": "127.0.0.1",
                 "port": 5044,
                 "tls": false,
                 "batch_max_size": 1,
                 "name": "tcp logger"
            }
       },
      "upstream": {
           "type": "roundrobin",
           "nodes": {
               "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
           }
      },
      "uri": "/hello"
}'
```

## Test Plugin

* success:

```shell
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/hello
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello, world
```

## Disable Plugin

Remove the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration to disable the `tcp-logger`.
APISIX plugins are hot-reloaded, therefore no need to restart APISIX.

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/hello",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
